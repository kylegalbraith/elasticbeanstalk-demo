This folder contains three testing files, `test.json`, `test2.json`, and `test3.json`. These are test models for the `/api/demos` endpoint.

To populate the API via the POST endpoints and to test the GET endpoints, run the following batch script.

```command
C:\>runTests.bat "<your-elasticbeanstalk-url>"
```
